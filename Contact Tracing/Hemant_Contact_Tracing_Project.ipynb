    "## Project Scope:\n",
    "With a need to trace a virus during an epidemic its important to trace daily interactions which can be shown with the help of graphs, where the Nodes can represent people and an edge can be a connection between them. Identifying the people to notify them as being exposed to the virus is the scope for this project, which is acheived by the following code. Here we have used Python's Networkx library for working with graphs."
